## How it works?
Basically it consists of a script that prevents you from being removed from servers for being afk.

## How to use it?
The script contains 3 different modes that consist of the following:
- Door Mode: A door opens and closes automatically every 10 seconds. 
- Moving Mode: The player automatically moves from left to right every 10 seconds. 
- Killing Mode: Player kills mobs every 4 seconds (Effective for farms).
